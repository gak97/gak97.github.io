I am a Chess Grandmaster and Software Engineer. I achieved the Grandmaster title in 2017, becoming India's 45th Grandmaster. I have represented India in various international chess competitions and have won multiple national and international tournaments.

In addition to chess, I am passionate about software engineering and technology. I specialize in developing efficient and scalable software solutions, with expertise in various programming languages and frameworks.

My unique background in both chess and software engineering allows me to bring analytical thinking, strategic planning, and problem-solving skills to both domains.
